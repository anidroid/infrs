      <h3>You have finished reading the posts.</h3>

      <p>Next, we would like to test your memory for the posts you've just read. You will see the same people together with certain words. Your task is to tell whether the word you see was mentioned in the post of the person whose face and name appear with the word  (OLD word) or whether it was not mentioned in the post (NEW word).</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class='example'>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="stimcomplete">

                        <h1>Thomas</h1>
                        <p>I am thrilled that Bob Dylan won the Nobel prize for literature.</p>
                        <div class="footer">
